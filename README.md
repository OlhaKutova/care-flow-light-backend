# CareFlow Lite Backend

CareFlow Lite is a demo telehealth-style application demonstrating a complete end-to-end workflow for managing patient consultations across multiple clinics.  
The application showcases secure mock authentication, GraphQL queries and mutations, and a responsive, modern interface built with a full-stack TypeScript setup.  
The primary objective is to provide a realistic example of a clinician-facing system that enables viewing and filtering consultations, creating new consultations, updating statuses, and recording notes â€” with emphasis on polished, intuitive frontend interactions.

This backend service is built with Node.js and TypeScript, providing a secure mock authentication flow, a GraphQL API for managing consultations, and Prisma ORM integration with Neon PostgreSQL.
